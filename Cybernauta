            <h2>Physical Measures (Safety)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Workspace:</strong> The premises have a height of 3 meters. Offices, commercial premises, service premises, or offices, 2.5 meters. The space per worker must be 2 square meters of surface and 10 cubic meters of volume.</li>
                <li><strong>Corridors:</strong> The main corridors are 1.20 meters wide. The secondary ones, 1 meter. They must be tidy, clean, and free of obstacles.</li>
                <li><strong>Doors:</strong> Correctly signposted, doors and exits. If they are transparent, they must have a sign at eye level. The width must be at least 80 cm. Emergency doors must never be closed. Sliding doors must have a safety system to prevent them from coming off the rails and falling. They should always open outwards.</li>
                <li><strong>Partitions and windows:</strong> If they are transparent or translucent, they must have the appropriate signage and be made of safe materials. The opening, closing, or fixing operations must be carried out safely. When open, they should not be a danger to workers.</li>
                <li><strong>Floor:</strong> It must be fixed, stable, and free of irregularities or slopes. It should not be slippery. It must be kept dry.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Environmental Measures</h2>
            <p>In our company, the only physical agents that can cause or contain problems are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Noise would be one of the problems for workers and can be solved by soundproofing or installing soundproof walls to avoid street noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Temperature would be one of the problems since the climate varies and to have the best comfort for workers, we would have an Aquaservice in the lounge/dining room, in the office and work area to stay hydrated.</li>
                <li><strong>Bad odor from bathrooms:</strong> This seems like a pretty absurd problem, but it is still a big problem for workers' performance. A solution is daily maintenance of the bathrooms and complete isolation with a door to prevent the bad smell from escaping and a window to ventilate the bad smell.</li>
                <li><strong>Vibrations:</strong> Vibrations can come from an earthquake in the locality. To solve this, we can have gloves or equipment on hand in the lockers to reduce the tremor or vibrations that may cause. We can also use metal or rubber material to absorb all or most of the vibrations so that they do not affect workers.</li>
                <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Lighting will not be a problem since there will be windows to let in sunlight and also lights per square meter of the area.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="social">
            <h2>Social Measures</h2>
            <p>Employees will be registered quarterly to fill out a survey about their position, how they feel at work, and their position. Additionally, if they want to talk to someone about any company or personal issue, they will have access to a psychologist from the same company. Everything they say in the sessions will stay in the sessions to maintain the professionalism and privacy of the worker.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="psychological">
            <h2>Psychological Measures</h2>
            <p>To address psychological measures, workers will have different shifts in which each one will have their own workplace to handle devices where they are not always sitting in the same office chair doing the same thing all the time, but they will vary their workplace. Each worker will have at least their corresponding hours of rest to eat, have breakfast, etc.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="first-aid">
            <h2>First Aid</h2>
            <p>In office first aid, there should be no problem, but just in case, we will be prepared for any kind of problem or accident. In this case, in the workers' area, we will have a defibrillator for the medical team if one is needed or if someone present knows how to use it to save a life. We will also have a phone with a direct line to emergencies for every two rooms to prevent problems. Each staff member will have protective equipment to handle the equipment they need to repair or prepare for sale.</p>
